# My dynamic website
My personal website, written using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MetalsmithJS and Markdown. A static version that is up and running can be found at http://gegerfelt.io/

# **THIS IS DEPRECATED** 30 May 2018
I am not updating this repo anymore. I only update the static version. It takes too much effort and time to update both, and because I don't want it to be a chore to update my website, I have decided to ignore this version. It was fun while it lasted.

Get the system running:
```node public/scripts/metalsmith.js && node app.js```
