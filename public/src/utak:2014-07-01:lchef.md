META is the Chapter House that is shared between the Media Technology Chapter and Computer Science Chapter at KTH. One representative from each chapter is together in charge of the Chapter House Group and is responsible for the care of META. META is the gathering point and lunch place available for about 2000 students, although it usually only houses about a tenth of that.
