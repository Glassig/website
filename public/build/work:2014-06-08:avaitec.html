	<p><em>Position:</em> Summerworker <br> Avaitec AB is a small consulting firm developing Sharepoint for company intranets. I wrote a Powershell script in order to
		transfer a lot of data from an old intranet to the new one without changing owner or date. I did some CSS work, one for a customer that had switched design and
		another for a potential new customer. <br><br> Timeperiod: Summers of 2014 &amp; 2015</p>
