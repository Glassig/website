	<p>The Reception for the Technical Base-year students was first created in the late Autumn 2013, and I was chosen to be second in command. The entire Reception were
		done by 12 people, with 277 new students. After 2014 we handed over the work to a new group of people, but in the summer of 2015 they had to cancel the reception.
		I decided to try organize a micro-reception in two months instead together with one other person, which we did successfully. <br> <em>Fria Sektionen/THS</em> <br><br>		Timeperiod: 2014-01-01:2015-12-31</p>
