	<p><em>Position:</em> Summer Intern Researcher <br> Me and one other intern developed tools and built a prototype for distributed video transcoding. I worked primarily
		in Gstreamer and Python, where I wrote a program for starting streams and then comparing the streamed video quality (PSNR) in order to test various streaming protocols,
		among other things. The tools we developed would later be used by other research departments. <br><br> Timeperiod: 2016-06-13:2016-08-26</p>
