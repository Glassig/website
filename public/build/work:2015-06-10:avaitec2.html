	<p><em>Position:</em> Summerworker <br> Avaitec AB is a small consulting firm developing Sharepoint for company intranets. I wrote a Powershell script in order to
		transfer a lot of data from an old intranet to the new one without changing owner or date. I also made some small CSS changes since the customer had switched design
		on their profile. <br><br> Timeperiod: 2015-06-10:2015-08-07</p>
